You need to install some number of fedora 20+ or RHEL machines.  Doesn't matter how
or where or whatever.  Real hardware, VMs, honey badger don't care.

Record the IP address of which machine you want to be your master
Record the IP address of the machine you want to be your etcd server
Record the IP addresses of the machines you want to be your minions.

Stick the system information into the 'inventory' file.  (ignore the
kube_ip_addr option until the network setup)

#### To set up ssh access via public keys ###################

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the root
pword for all nodes in ~/rootpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.
See the comments in keys.yml to explain the failing ping and offer some other
options.

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ping.yml # This will look like it fails, that's ok
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory keys.yml

#### To set up a hackish static networking for the pods #####

Decide what /24 network each one of your minions should use to expose pods.  You
need a /24 for EACH minion.
The network ranges you picked above go in their respective kube_ip_addr= vars.

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory hack-network.yml

#### Set up the services IP addresses ######################

Kubernetes services have fake IP addresses.  You must specify a range of IP
addresses which will not conflict with anything in your infrastructure which
kube can use for services.  To do so edit:

group_vars/all.yml

#### To set up the actual kubernetes cluster ###############

You already did the config!  Just run the setup.

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory setup.yml

This works on RHEL7, Atomic, F20, F21 and rawhide.

For RHEL7 it will set up rhn subscriptions.  Put your username in a file named: ~/rhn_username.  Put your rhn password into a file named ~/rhn_password
